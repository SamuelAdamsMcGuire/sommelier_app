The nutty, warm finish helps, but overall it lacks sophistication and its parts aren't in full unity.",Dona Antonia Personal Reserve,83,22.0,Port,,,Michael Schachner,@wineschach,Ferreira NV Dona Antonia Personal Reserve  (Port),Port,Ferreira,red,no
127619,Portugal,"With strong wood flavors this is a wine that shows some good aging. It has spice, toffee and a rich texture. The wine is full, rich, mature and balanced.",The Tawny,90,30.0,Port,,,Roger Voss,@vossroger,W. & J. Graham's NV The Tawny  (Port),Port,W. & J. Graham's,red,no
127678,Portugal,"An awkward geranium aroma mars this firm and concentrated wine. It's dry and tannic, with a solid edge akin to black currant skin. The fruit is well hidden at this stage.",Vintage,87,70.0,Port,,,Roger Voss,@vossroger,Quevedo 2010 Vintage  (Port),Port,Quevedo,red,no
127735,Portugal,"Passion-fruit aromas are mingled with a strongly perfumed character that comes from Touriga Nacional and Touriga Franca. It is ripe with some firm structure, powered with dark tannins as well as this hugely perfumed fruit. Drink from 2026.",Vintage,88,90.0,Port,,,Roger Voss,@vossroger,Duorum 2015 Vintage  (Port),Port,Duorum,red,no
128736,Portugal,"This Port, still young to taste, is a dry style of LBV giving structure as much as fruit at this stage. It does have floral black fruits from the Touriga Nacional in the blend. It also has a firm core that will certainly soften. So although this wine can be drunk now, it will be so much better from 2019.",Late Bottled Vintage,90,26.0,Port,,,Roger Voss,@vossroger,Offley 2012 Late Bottled Vintage  (Port),Port,Offley,red,no
128904,Portugal,"A dry style of tawny, bringing out wood aging as well as rich mellow fruit. The wine has an old gold feel to it, with butter toffee, butterscotch and final acidity.",Ten Year Old Aged Tawny,89,,Port,,,Roger Voss,@vossroger,Croft NV Ten Year Old Aged Tawny  (Port),Port,Croft,red,no
128943,US,"Made only in optimal years and from a mysterious blend of varieties (most likely Petite Sirah-based), Opportunity is strong in coffee, leather and baked plum, balanced but exuberant in a luxurious texture with a nutty finish. It is fortified with grape brandy and made in a tawny style.",Opportunity,89,26.0,California,Livermore Valley,Central Coast,Virginie Boone,@vboone,Occasio 2010 Opportunity Port (Livermore Valley),Port,Occasio,red,no
