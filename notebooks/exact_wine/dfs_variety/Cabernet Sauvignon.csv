129734,US,"Robust, pillowy tannins provide a density and grip that lasts through the finish of this 100% varietal wine. Blackberry, black currant and vanilla are the highlights, finding balance and powerful concentration on the palate.",Cabernet Sauvignon,90,70.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Virginie Boone,@vboone,Apsara 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Cabernet Sauvignon,Apsara,red,no
129739,US,"Blackberry juice mixes with graphite, cedar and dried herbs on this bottling by Fred Brander and Fabian Bravo, which is more focused on earth than ripe fruit. Bright boysenberry fruit is lifted on the palate by more dried herbs and hints of purple flowers.",Reserve,90,50.0,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Central Coast,Matt Kettmann,@mattkettmann,Brander 2014 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Ynez Valley),Cabernet Sauvignon,Brander,red,no
129756,US,"In the blend are smaller percentages of Cab Franc, Merlot and Petit Verdot. The Red Mountain AVA is noted for thick, tannic wines, with superior aging potential. Here the earthy, peppery red fruits are buttressed with vivid acids and somewhat chewy tannins. The wine was aged two years in 40% new French oak.",La Bestia,87,55.0,Washington,Red Mountain,Columbia Valley,Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine ,Lachini 2011 La Bestia Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain),Cabernet Sauvignon,Lachini,red,no
129829,US,"Black cherry and blueberry fruit flavors are accompanied by a definite note of mushroom, much as in many lesser Bordeaux. There's a little lift from moderate volatile acidity, and a mix of coffee, blueberry and smoke through the finish.",Cabernet Sauvignon,86,15.0,Washington,Rattlesnake Hills,Columbia Valley,Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine ,Roza Ridge 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Rattlesnake Hills),Cabernet Sauvignon,Roza Ridge,red,no
129833,US,"Very ripe, soft and sugary sweet, this Cab has flavors of blackberries, cherries, mocha and caramelized oak. It doesn't really taste like the kind of tannic, ageworthy wine you expect from Diamond Mountain. Drink now.",Cabernet Sauvignon,86,60.0,California,Diamond Mountain District,Napa,,,Coniglio 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District),Cabernet Sauvignon,Coniglio,red,no
129891,US,"Chocolate, mocha and coconut notes highlight this wine's lush, soft tannins that grow chalky as they firm. Cedar, pencil shaving and saddle leather notes complement its voluptuous ripeness.",Estate Block 3,91,100.0,California,Calistoga,Napa,Virginie Boone,@vboone,Jax 2013 Estate Block 3 Cabernet Sauvignon (Calistoga),Cabernet Sauvignon,Jax,red,no
129906,US,"Pencil shaving and graphite notes lend a classic edge to this 100% varietal wine that's sourced from throughout the valley. Juicy huckleberry flavor meets a background of grippy tannin and oak, giving it chewiness and weight, lifted by acidity.",Cabernet Sauvignon,91,35.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Virginie Boone,@vboone,Conn Creek 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Cabernet Sauvignon,Conn Creek,red,no
129913,US,"This is taut and dense, and requires time and air to untangle. Deep, dark fruits are mixed in with layers of black olive, smoke, compost, tar, moist earth and herb—a delicious mélange of flavors that promises good things to come as the wine ages. It's masterful winemaking in a package so young and wrapped up tight that it may pass you by if you don't give it a good look.",Artist Series #14,92,44.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine ,Woodward Canyon 2005 Artist Series #14 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),Cabernet Sauvignon,Woodward Canyon,red,no
129914,US,"Fritz has made tremendous progress with Cab over the years, and their '05 represents an exciting new step. It's true to the variety, a smoothly dry, tannic wine that brims with currants, cherries and cocoa. Yet it showcases the brambly, briary, peppery notes you find in the best Dry Creek Valley Cabs.",Cabernet Sauvignon,91,35.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,,,Fritz 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Dry Creek Valley),Cabernet Sauvignon,Fritz,red,no
129942,US,"This is classic in herbaceous aromas and flavors, rich in juicy blackberry and blueberry while also offering savory pencil shavings and dark chocolate. Leathered, firm tannins complete the picture, providing structure and integration to a wall of well-managed oak.",Cabernet Sauvignon,90,35.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Virginie Boone,@vboone,Arrowood 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County),Cabernet Sauvignon,Arrowood,red,no
129963,Israel,"A bouquet of black cherry, tart cranberry and clove opens into flavors of cherry, anisette, espresso bean and mint, with a hint of tart cranberry. The minty notes can almost seem overly strong for a moment, but tart tones bring the fruit flavors back to the foreground. The pleasantly gripping tannins will mellow with a few more years of aging.",Oak Aged,90,20.0,Galilee,,,Mike DeSimone,@worldwineguys,Dalton 2012 Oak Aged Cabernet Sauvignon (Galilee),Cabernet Sauvignon,Dalton,red,no
