129393,Argentina,"Huge and extracted, with an opaque purple color and a massive, aggressive nose that hints at stewed fruit, sweaty leather, blackberry compote and shoe polish. Forget elegance and go straight for this wine's unbridled size and density.

129429,US,"Fresh aromas of dark violets, sweet lavender, elderberry and a light teriyaki glaze show on the nose of this extra barrel-aged bottling. It's medium bodied on the palate, where dark fruits meet with elderflower and more purple flowers.

129476,US,"Lots of delicious blackberry, cherry, cola, roasted meat and sandalwood flavors in this Syrah.

129546,US,"Baked blackberry, vanilla, caramel and tar on the nose make for a very inviting entry into this rich Syrah from Bibiana González Rave, whose father-in-law, Gary Pisoni, co-developed this vineyard.

New-oak aromas like clove, cedar and cinnamon explode out of the glass, then flavors of dark chocolate and cherry spread across the palate for a generous—almost thick—impression.
