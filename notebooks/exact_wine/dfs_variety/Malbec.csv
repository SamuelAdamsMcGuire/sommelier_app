A compact, firm palate is just lush enough, while oak-based flavors of cinnamon and baking spices rest on top of spiced plum and cassis. A peppery finish is intermixed with tobacco notes. Drink through 2021.",Icono,91,25.0,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,,Michael Schachner,@wineschach,Penedo Borges 2012 Icono Malbec (Luján de Cuyo),Malbec,Penedo Borges,red,no
129917,Argentina,"This dark, meaty Malbec has some Agrelo fruit in it but it's mostly from La Consulta and Vista Flores in the Uco Valley. Aged in new oak for 18 months, it smells rich, smooth and inviting, with asphalt, mineral, violet and coffee aromas. The palate has bold acidity and healthy flavors that settle on blackberry and dark chocolate. Drink now through 2011.",Piedra Negra,91,40.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Michael Schachner,@wineschach,J. & F. Lurton 2004 Piedra Negra Malbec (Mendoza),Malbec,J. & F. Lurton,red,no
129921,Argentina,"There is a select group of under-$20 Malbecs from Argentina that really do the country and the variety proud. Santos is one of them; the 2006 is easy and ripe on the nose, with lovely cola, berry and herb aromas. The palate has a natural feel and bright black-fruit flavors. Not overly complex but a winner for the next year or two.",La Madras Vineyard,91,18.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Michael Schachner,@wineschach,Ricardo Santos 2006 La Madras Vineyard Malbec (Mendoza),Malbec,Ricardo Santos,red,no
129938,Argentina,"Compared to the regular 2006 Malbec from Chakana, this wine steps up in weight class and wins the crown. It's a serious but inviting red with spongey, ripe berry aromas topped by pure raspberry, cherry and cola flavors. It's both racy and composed, with a pile of bitter chocolate on the long finish. Good through 2009 at least.",Reserve,91,25.0,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,,Michael Schachner,@wineschach,Chakana 2006 Reserve Malbec (Luján de Cuyo),Malbec,Chakana,red,no
129948,Argentina,"Raspberry and cassis aromas are fresh and upright while showing wiry, grassy accents. Full bodied, this features a jammy, pulpy palate that's fresh but low on definition. Herbal, lightly green infiltrations drift onto a solid, tannic finish. Drink through 2018.",Pedernal,90,43.0,Other,San Juan,,Michael Schachner,@wineschach,Finca Las Moras 2010 Pedernal Malbec (San Juan),Malbec,Finca Las Moras,red,no
