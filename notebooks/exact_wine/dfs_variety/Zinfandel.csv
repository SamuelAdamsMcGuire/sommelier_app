129625,US,"A field blend from the DeMayo Vineyard, believed to be mostly Zin and Petite Sirah. The resulting wine doesn't show much of its provenance or history, just a smidgen of spice but only fruit and modest of flavor.",DeMayo Vineyard,84,30.0,California,Livermore Valley,Central Coast,Virginie Boone,@vboone,Darcie Kent Vineyards 2009 DeMayo Vineyard Zinfandel (Livermore Valley),Zinfandel,Darcie Kent Vineyards,red,no
129627,US,"Made in the winery's style, which is ripe, full-bodied and rustic.

129664,US,"This is one of the best Lodi Native wine yet. It has beautiful, soft, fruit and floral aromas, luxurious and soothing berry and black-currant flavors and a layered texture that seems to melt in the mouth.

129679,US,"From a ranch planted originally in 1926 this is a knockout wine, exotically spiced and nuanced in pepper, cinnamon and a distinction of sandalwood.

129762,US,"It shows ultrarich tannins and a flavor complexity ranging from briary wild blackberries and prunes to currants, nettles, sweet tea and softened cola. It's absolutely dry, despite or perhaps because of very high alcohol. The wine is unapologetic about that ripeness, instead asking only to be happily paired with barbecue.",Zinfandel,87,20.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,,,Novy 2012 Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),Zinfandel,Novy,red,no
