129828,South Africa,"This wine has a slightly quiet and tight nose, but opens up into flavors of pineapple and melon buoyed by a steely minerality. Friendly and heightened with a lush character, the wine will pair well with cheeses, poultry and seafood.",Chenin Blanc,86,9.0,Robertson,,,Susan Kostrzewa,@suskostrzewa,Robertson Winery 2008 Chenin Blanc (Robertson),Chenin Blanc,Robertson Winery,white,no
129945,US,"Hailing from one of the more popular vineyards for this varietal in the whole Central Coast, this wine by Bonny Doon vets Alex Krause and John Locke offers aromas of apple cider, mandarin spritzer and lemon rinds. The palate boasts the flavors but not tartness of ruby red grapefruit along with a subtle apple mousse, and a tension that hovers on a chalky, slightly bitter minerality.",Jurassic Park Vineyard Old Vines,90,20.0,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Central Coast,Matt Kettmann,@mattkettmann,Birichino 2013 Jurassic Park Vineyard Old Vines Chenin Blanc (Santa Ynez Valley),Chenin Blanc,Birichino,white,no
