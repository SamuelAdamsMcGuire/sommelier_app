# Sommelier App

Working with a real life Sommelier, a scraped data set from Wine Enthusiast, and my python skills I developed a app that would recommend a wine variety (and suggest a wine) based on 5 your answers from questions. You are also able to choose which machine learning model you prefer.

The program architecture is all set from the root directorly. So when using bash to run any scripts please use the following sturcture
